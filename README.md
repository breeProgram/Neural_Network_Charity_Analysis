# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Introduction
With knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, this project was to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soup’s business team, a dataset with a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years will be asseted using Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Tensorflow with a goal of over 75% accuracy in predicting success. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
